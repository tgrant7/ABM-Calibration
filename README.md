# ABM-Calibration

Files to reproduce calibration analysis in:

Grant, T.J., and S.P. Bradbury. 2019. The role of modeling in monarch butterfly research and conservation. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 7: 197. https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00197

The model was calibrated to empirical data collected by Teresa Blader in roadsides in Iowa. 

Monarchs - Teresa's Data.mxd is ArcMap project that shows the shapefiles involved. 

TeresaTestData.shp and associated files is the shapefile used in the agent-based model with pre-calibration probEggs. 

TeresaTestData2.shp and associated files are the shapefile used in the agent-based model with post-calibration probEggs. 

CumEggsPerZone.2017.Oct.06.12_14_34.txt is the cumulative eggs per zone output pre-calibration.

CumEggsPerZone.2017.Oct.06.17_47_47.txt is the cumulative eggs per zone output post-calibration. 

TeresaData.R has data analysis. 

scen2woBuffs_export.dbf is used in TeresaData.R

TeresaPolys.dbf is used in TeresaData.R

Teresa_data.xlsx has some calculations and the figure for the paper.
