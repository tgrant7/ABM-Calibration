# ABM-Calibration

Files to reproduce calibration analysis in:

Grant, T.J., and S.P. Bradbury. 2019. The role of modeling in monarch butterfly research and conservation. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 7: 197. https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00197

The model was calibrated to empirical collected by Teresa Blader in roadsides in Iowa. 

Monarchs - Teresa's Data.mxd is ArcMap project that shows the shapefiles involved. 

TeresaTestData.shp and associated files are the shapefile used in the agent-based model with pre-calibration probEggs. 
TeresaTestData2.shp and associated files are the shapefile used in the agent-based model with post-calibration probEggs.
